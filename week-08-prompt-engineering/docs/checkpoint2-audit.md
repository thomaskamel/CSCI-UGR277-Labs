# Checkpoint 2 Readiness Assessment
**Project Name:** Financial Fraud Detection System  
**Component Owner:** Thomas Kamel (AI Core & Process Integration)  

## 1. Executive Summary
The Financial Fraud Detection System is architecture-ready for Checkpoint 2 execution. Core multi-layered LLM orchestration engines (Flowise) and ingestion handling layers are fully deployed. The pipeline successfully transforms raw unstructured logs into structured risk categories and comprehensive playbooks. 

## 2. Component Blueprint Status
* **Ingestion (Ergi):** Functional. Successfully captures raw webhook alerts and streams initial metadata states.
* **AI Core (Thomas):** Functional. Deployed three distinct inference layers via n8n HTTP automation mapping to Groq (llama-3.3-70b-versatile).
* **Specialist (Andrew):** Functional. Consumes structural AI threat indicators and successfully outputs finalized response playbooks.

## 3. Data Schema & State Management
* **Database Engine:** Airtable Relational Schema
* **Key Fields:** `alert_id`, `source_log`, `severity`, `threat_indicators`, `playbook_json`, `status`
* **Handoff Flags:** State tracking is successfully driven via lowercase identifiers: `pending_triage` -> `analyzed` -> `remediated`.

## 4. Gap & Risk Mitigation Analysis
* **Identified Gap:** State-trigger handoffs between components are manually advanced in the workflow engine rather than triggering 100% autonomously on database state updates.
* **Resolution Strategy:** Finalize the active backend polling triggers inside the n8n canvas to transition records instantaneously upon row inserts.
* **Technical Risk:** Complex formatting breaks caused by unpredictably nested characters in live unstructured text blocks.
* **Mitigation Step Already Taken:** Wrapped all multi-layered inter-agent requests inside automated serialization syntax (`jsonStringify()`) to prevent JSON execution failures.

## 5. Advisor Evaluation
The system demonstrates structural integrity and data policy adherence (snake_case conventions, isolated data boundaries). Completion of the webhook polling trigger loop will establish a fully automated end-to-end data pipeline.
