### 2026-05-16 — Multi-Layered Flowise JSON Control Character Bug

**Context:**
I was working inside my n8n workflow canvas attempting to cleanly pipe text output from Call Chain 1 (Alert Classifier) and Call Chain 2 (Threat Analyzer) forward into Call Chain 3 (Response Recommender) using standard text injection syntax inside the HTTP Request JSON body configuration panel.

**Prompt:**
```text
{ "question": "Recommend response actions for this threat analysis: {{ $json.text }}" }
