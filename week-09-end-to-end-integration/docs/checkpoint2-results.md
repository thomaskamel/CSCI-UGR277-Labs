# Checkpoint 2 Results
**Date:** 2026-05-20
**Team:** Fraud Detection Team

**Test record:** A production batch of 35 historical bank transactions imported via CSV (ranging from a $11.99 Spotify charge to a $125,000.00 wire transfer to Lagos).

## End-to-End Status: PARTIAL
*The pipeline successfully automates data ingestion, executes complex conditional AI core enrichment loops, updates original transaction records, and extracts high-risk targets into a Case Management database table. However, an n8n expression parsing bug corrupted field data at the final stage.*

## Component-by-Component Results

### Ingestion
**Status:** Working
**What happened:** The "Transaction Ingestion" workflow successfully triggered manually. It pulled the production data from the external CSV source, parsed and normalized the fields, and successfully pushed 35 transaction records into Airtable with an initial status of `unprocessed`.

### AI Core
**Status:** Working
**What happened:** The "Anomaly Detection & AI Enrichment" pipeline automatically fetched the `unprocessed` rows. It cleanly executed an `If` conditional branch splitting normal vs. high-value transactions, routed them through Hugging Face and Groq HTTP nodes, and wrote back risk scores, anomaly flags, and generated text explanations while updating the status to `processed`.

### Specialist
**Status:** Partially Working
**What happened:** The "Case Management" workflow successfully executed on the AI Core's output, automatically pulling the 7 high-risk transactions (where risk score equaled `1.0`). It generated custom `case_id` numbers and mapped the source transaction references perfectly. However, the node failed to parse an n8n syntax string properly, dropping raw code blocks into the `assigned_to` field.

### Integration Dashboard
**Status:** Partially Working
**What happened:** The underlying database links work seamlessly, but because the `assigned_to` column contains raw code strings instead of evaluated values, downstream tracking views are currently showing distorted data metrics.

## Gaps Found
1. **Critical Syntax Error in Specialist Node:** The case generation node is writing a literal string look-up formula (`{{ $json.fields.risk_score ... }}`) into the Airtable `assigned_to` field instead of resolving the actual value.
2. **Dynamic Owner Assignment Logic:** The system maps the field directly to an evaluation metric string rather than routing the case to a real human analyst team or tier group.

## Fix Plan
1. **Mend n8n Property Syntax Mapping:** Modify the data reference syntax within the Specialist "Create Case" node to pass clean string data. (Owner: Thomas Kamel | Effort: 15 mins)
2. **Clear and Re-simulate Pipeline:** Flush the corrupted string records out of the Airtable Cases view and re-trigger the ingestion suite to confirm clean field populations. (Owner: Thomas Kamel | Effort: 20 mins)
